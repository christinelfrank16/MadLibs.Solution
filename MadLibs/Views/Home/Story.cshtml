    <h1>A fantastical adventure</h1>
    <p> One day, @Model.PersonOne and 
        @Model.PersonTwo were walking through the woods, when suddenly a giant 
        @Model.Animal appeared. 
        "@Model.Verb," 
        @Model.PersonOne cried. The two of them 
        @Model.Verb as quickly possible, and when they were safe, 
        @Model.PersonOne and 
        @Model.PersonTwo gave each other a giant 
        @Model.Noun.
